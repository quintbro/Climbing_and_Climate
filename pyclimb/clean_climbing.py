    mountainproject.com and using the dataConcat function also found in this module
    inplace: setting this equal to true will change the data frame that you pass in.
    setting equal to false will return a modified copy

    This function will return a cleaned pd.dataframe object as follows:

    This function will change "Rating" into two boolean factors, one for PG13 and one for R
    It will separate the Location column into 5 different columns called 
    "State", "Region", "Location", "Crag", and "Wall"

    it will change "Route Type" into separate boolean columns for each type namely
    'Trad', 'Alpine', 'TR', 'Aid', 'Boulder', 'Mixed' and 'Sport'

    Creates an encoding for the YSD ratings called Rating_num
    The encoding is as follows:
    'a', 'a/b', '-', 'b', 'b/c', '', 'c', 'c/d', '+', 'd' are mapped to 
    '.2', '.3', '.3', '.4', '.5', '.5', '.6', '.7', '.7', '.8' respectively
    and the first number remains the same and the 5 is dropped.

    NOTE: This does not create anything for boulder or ice/mixed or any other rating system
    it only uses the YSD

    Lastly this function will convert any values that are -1 in the Rating column 
    to np.NaN values
